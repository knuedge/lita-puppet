We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our IT staff encourage ethical contribution to our open source projects and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE), and its [README](README.md).
